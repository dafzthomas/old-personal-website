    <p>Over the years I have given many attempts to my personal website and have never settled on something that will last forever, so here it is!</p>
    <p>I have decided I must stick to a URL (which has changed multiple times) and try to keep my corner of the web as permanent as possible.</p>
    <p>I'm hoping to start writing about my journey as a Full Stack JavaScript Developer on here. None of it genius, but rather stuff I'm learning along the way and anything I find relatively interesting.</p>
    <p>Wish me luck!</p>
