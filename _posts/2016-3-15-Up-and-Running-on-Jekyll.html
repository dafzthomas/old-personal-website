postExcerpt:
  This is my first post written in Jekyll and showing why I've chosen to
  use the static site generator and the type of hosting!

  <p class="drop-cap-p">
    Yes this site is not run in WordPress; yes it is statically generated by
    Jekyll. What is Jekyll? There are only a few reasons I have used Jekyll.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Speed</li>
    <li>Modularity</li>
    <li>Free hosting</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For the most part, I previously used WordPress because of how modular it was
    to create a style/theme. It ensured that I didn't duplicate common things
    like the header and footer. Simple stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    The free hosting is from Github allowing me to any front end code I choose.
    The only drawback is I cannot have anything that is server side like a
    contact form.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've decided not to use a contact form as it's pretty useless for my uses.
    If someone really wants to contact me, they can click my email on the left
    if you're on desktop and in the footer if you're on mobile.
  </p>
  <p>That's it, thanks for visiting!</p>
